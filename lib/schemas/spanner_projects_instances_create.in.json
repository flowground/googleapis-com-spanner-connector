Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of\nresources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.\nAnd they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,\nfirewall, load balancing, etc.).\n\n * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to\n   the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`.\n * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform\n   to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`.\n * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.\n\nSee https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.\n\nIf you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional\ncharacters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an\ninternal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon\nspecific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels\nas the string:  name + \"_\" + value  would prove problematic if we were to\nallow \"_\" in a future release.",
