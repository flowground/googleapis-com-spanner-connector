These keys can be open or\nclosed, indicating if the range includes rows with that key.\n\nKeys are represented by lists, where the ith value in the list\ncorresponds to the ith component of the table or index primary key.\nIndividual values are encoded as described here.\n\nFor example, consider the following table definition:\n\n    CREATE TABLE UserEvents (\n      UserName STRING(MAX),\n      EventDate STRING(10)\n    ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);\n\nThe following keys name rows in this table:\n\n    \"Bob\", \"2014-09-23\"\n\nSince the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two\ncolumns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the first is the\n`UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.\n\nKey ranges with multiple components are interpreted\nlexicographically by component using the table or index key's declared\nsort order. For example, the following range returns all events for\nuser `\"Bob\"` that occurred in the year 2015:\n\n    \"start_closed\": [\"Bob\", \"2015-01-01\"]\n    \"end_closed\": [\"Bob\", \"2015-12-31\"]\n\nStart and end keys can omit trailing key components. This affects the\ninclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided key\ncomponents: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match the\nprovided components are included; if the key is open, then rows\nthat exactly match are not included.\n\nFor example, the following range includes all events for `\"Bob\"` that\noccurred during and after the year 2000:\n\n    \"start_closed\": [\"Bob\", \"2000-01-01\"]\n    \"end_closed\": [\"Bob\"]\n\nThe next example retrieves all events for `\"Bob\"`:\n\n    \"start_closed\": [\"Bob\"]\n    \"end_closed\": [\"Bob\"]\n\nTo retrieve events before the year 2000:\n\n    \"start_closed\": [\"Bob\"]\n    \"end_open\": [\"Bob\", \"2000-01-01\"]\n\nThe following range includes all rows in the table:\n\n    \"start_closed\": []\n    \"end_closed\": []\n\nThis range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with any\ncharacter from A to C:\n\n    \"start_closed\": [\"A\"]\n    \"end_open\": [\"D\"]\n\nThis range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with B:\n\n    \"start_closed\": [\"B\"]\n    \"end_open\": [\"C\"]\n\nKey ranges honor column sort order. For example, suppose a table is\ndefined as follows:\n\n    CREATE TABLE DescendingSortedTable {\n      Key INT64,\n      ...\n    ) PRIMARY KEY(Key DESC);\n\nThe following range retrieves all rows with key values between 1\nand 100 inclusive:\n\n    \"start_closed\": [\"100\"]\n    \"end_closed\": [\"1\"]\n\nNote that 100 is passed as the start, and 1 is passed as the end,\nbecause `Key` is a descending column in the schema.",
